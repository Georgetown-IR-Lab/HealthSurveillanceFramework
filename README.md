# HealthSurveillanceFramework
This repository contains the reference implementation of our framework for public health surveillance. The framework's architecture is illustrated in architecture.pdf.

# Code
The repository's primary purpose is to illustrate the framework's architecture and API. We are in the process of releasing the code described in [1] that conforms to *HealthSurveillanceFramework*'s API. We will continue to release additional code with new publications.

* framework: contains Python abstract classes for implementing the framework's API
* component/example: contains simple examples of each component
* data/example: contains synthetic data for use with the component examples
